					<p>1. Bring Some Comfy Bedding</p>

					<p>A luxurious comfy bed is the key to the best glamping in your life. It will make all of your hard day worth it when you lay down on those super soft pillows and warm blankets, though it will make it harder to get out the next morning. For laying down outside, a hammock is an essential part of the experience.</p> <br>
					<p>2. Add Touches of Home</p>

					<p>By adding some soft rugs around the bed area, some candles and a couple of throw blankets one can make the tent very cozy and homey and from camp to glamp. You can find great items at flea markets, just don't bring fragile items as you're still in the woods.</p> <br>
					<p>3. Light Up Your Space</p>

					<p>Lights create ambience to the space, these can be fake candles or mini LED lights work perfectly for an amazing glamping trip with low effort. If you're able to get your hands on a solar power lantern, you will be very sustainable during your trip! </p><br>
					<p>4. Make a Comfy Living Room Outdoors</p>

					<p>By having furniture that you can kickback in, you'll be able to have some great relaxing time outdoors with others. You can stay pretty simple or go quite modern in your furniture aesthetic, and always make it stand out by having lots of tables and throw pillows and blankets for the chairs. Cupholders will also make putting down drinks a lot easier while being outside all while keeping it close at hand. Lastly, you might want to consider a high-tech fire pit, not only for the looks but also it is very safe as it lets you control the blaze. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YE1FWA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=str0202-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B004YE1FWA&linkId=dd29f6e57df5fb570c9f8c0200f88ec8">Here</a> is an option for a nice fire pit.</p><br>
					<p>5. Make a Gourmet Meal</p>

					<p>So maybe not a full on gourmet meal, but you can still bring a cast iron and a cooler so that you can have some meats and a refreshing salad. You can also make or some desserts such as ice cream or cinnamon rolls that you can heat up in the cast iron. The more people the merrier so each can bring something to add to the menu.</p><br>
					<p>6. Set Up Stations</p>

					<p>Like we mentioned, when you travel with friends and family it can add to the fun, so by attempting to have some organization, stations are going to be your friend. You can set up a table for drinks, another one, or two, for food and snacks, and one for blankets, hand sanitizer and other first aid stuff is a must for being outdoors. Plan to have some signs for everyone to read so that they know what is where. </p><br>
					<p>7. Bring the Entertainment With You</p>
